A collaborator recently asked me to do power calculations for the population attributable fraction (PAF) of a dichotomous exposure, $F$, for an incident outcome, $D$. In a previous iteration, I had used standard sample size and power calcuation approaches to get a minimum detectable relative risk assuming known sample size, outcome rate, exposure prevalence, and 80% power. While there is a paper by Browner and Newman (1989) for sample size and power for the PAF, I think an alternate approach could use the minimum detectable relative risk (RR) and the relationship between the PAF and RR. 

### Definition of population attributable fraction

The population attributable fraction is typically defined by the proportion of disease incidence in a population that is attributable to the exposure of interest, specified by 
$$PAF = \displaystyle\frac{P(D) - P(D\vert \bar{F})}{P(D)},$$
where $P(D)$ is the prevalence of the outcome in the overall population and $P(D\vert \bar{F})$ is the prevalence of the outcome among those that are not exposed. Using Bayes' rule or the law of total probability, i.e., $$P(D)=P(D\vert F)P(F)+P(D\vert \bar{F})P(\bar{F}),$$ the PAF can be expressed in terms of the exposure prevalence $P(F)$ and the relative risk given by $RR=P(D\vert F)/P(D|F)$ as follows:

$$\begin{align*}
PAF &= \displaystyle\frac{P(D) - P(D\vert \bar{F})}{P(D)} \\
&= \displaystyle\frac{P(D\vert F)P(F)+P(D\vert \bar{F})P(\bar{F}) - P(D\vert \bar{F})}{P(D\vert F)P(F)+P(D\vert \bar{F})P(\bar{F})}\\
&= \displaystyle\frac{P(D\vert F)P(F)+P(D\vert \bar{F})(1-P(F)) - P(D\vert \bar{F})}{P(D\vert F)P(F)+P(D\vert \bar{F})(1-P(F))}\\
&= \displaystyle\frac{P(F)[P(D\vert F) - P(D\vert\bar{F})]}{P(\bar{F})[P(D\vert F)-P(D\bar{F})] + P(D\vert\bar{F}}\\
&= \displaystyle\frac{P(F)\left[\displaystyle\frac{P(D\vert F)}{P(D\vert\bar{F})}-1 \right]}{P(F)\left[\displaystyle\frac{P(D\vert F)}{P(D\vert\bar{F})} - 1 \right] + 1}\\
&= \displaystyle\frac{P(F)[RR - 1]}{P(F)[RR - 1] + 1}
\end{align*}$$
