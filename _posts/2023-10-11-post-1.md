It's always mentioned that the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC or AUC) for a non-informative or "no-skill" risk score or classifier (e.g., coin flip) is 0.5, but I have never seem this formalized. Same for the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). Here are some *heuristic arguments* for both.

Let $X$ be a random variable representing a continuous risk score with survivor function $S_X(x) = P(X > x)$ and $D$ a dichotomous random variable with a $Bernoulli(\pi)$ distribution representing, say, disease status. I would characterize a non-informative or no-skill risk score as one that can't discriminate between individuals who have and do not have the disease, i.e., $X$ and $D$ are independent given by $P(X|D) = P(X)$. This implies that $P(X > c|D = 1) = P(X > c|D=0)$, which I will use.

## AUC for non-informative classifier is 0.5
Recall that points on the ROC curve are given by $(P(X>c|D=1), P(X>c|D=0)),$ spanning over all possible thresholds $c$. 

Because of this, points on the ROC curve, given by (P(X > cjÂ¯D);P(X > cjD)) are the same as
(P(X > cjD);P(X > cjD)) - just the diagonal line! So the AUC is then 0.5, the area under the diagonal line.
