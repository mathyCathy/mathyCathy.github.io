It's always mentioned that the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC or AUC) for a non-informative or `no-skill'classifier (e.g., coin flip) is 0.5, but I have never seem this formalized. Same for the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). Here are some heuristic arguments for both.


An uniformative classifier is one where P(X > cjD) = P(X > cj¯D), i.e., it doesn’t discriminate between true cases
or noncases. Because of this, points on the ROC curve, given by (P(X > cj¯D);P(X > cjD)) are the same as
(P(X > cjD);P(X > cjD)) - just the diagonal line! So the AUC is then 0.5, the area under the diagonal line.
