For ANOVA with equal group sizes $n_1=n_2=\dots=n_G$, and common variance $\sigma^2$. Let $N$ denote the total sample size, i.e., $N=n_1+\dots+n_G$, and $\mu_W$ denoted the weighted mean of all groups. Additionally, define $\sigma_m^2$ as follows:

$$\sigma_m^2 = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^G \displaystyle\frac{n_i}{N}\left(\mu_i - \mu_W \right)^2.$$ 

Cohen (1988) defined the effect size $f$ as:

$$f = \sqrt{\displaystyle\frac{\sigma_m^2}{\sigma^2}}.$$

Under the alternative hypothesis, the 1-way ANOVA test statistic follows a non-central F-distribution, $F_{G-1, N-G, \alpha}$, with non-centrality parameter $\lambda = Nf^2$, where $\alpha$ is the type I error rate.
